# OCP Admin Gate Acknowledgment Analysis

Verify that admin gates from the baseline OpenShift version are properly acknowledged in the target version's managed-cluster-config.

## When to Use

- Planning managed cluster upgrades (OSD, ROSA)
- Validating upgrade readiness
- Identifying missing acknowledgment files
- Detecting unacknowledged admin gates that would block upgrades
- CI/CD pipelines that need to verify upgrade prerequisites

## Workflow

1. Parse baseline and target versions (default: auto-detect latest stable → latest candidate)
2. Fetch admin gate ConfigMap from cluster-version-operator repo (baseline version)
3. Check if admin gates exist in the ConfigMap's `data` field
4. If gates exist, fetch admin acknowledgment ConfigMap from managed-cluster-config repo (target version)
5. Validate that all gates are properly acknowledged
6. Report upgrade readiness status and generate detailed reports

## Script Usage

**Auto-detect versions (recommended):**
```bash
# Compares latest stable → latest candidate
python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py

# With verbose output
python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py --verbose

# Custom report directory
python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py --report-dir /custom/reports
```

**Explicit versions:**
```bash
python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py \
  --baseline <version> \
  --target <version> \
  [--report-dir <path>] \
  [--verbose]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Auto-detect
python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py

# Explicit versions (uses minor versions: 4.21, 4.22)
python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py --baseline 4.21 --target 4.22

# With verbose output
python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py --baseline 4.21.7 --target 4.22.0 --verbose

# Environment variables
BASE_VERSION=4.21 TARGET_VERSION=4.22 python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py

# Custom report location
REPORT_DIR=/ci-artifacts python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py
```

**Generated Reports:**
```bash
reports/gap-analysis-ocp-gate-ack_4.21_to_4.22_20260327_120000.html  # HTML
reports/gap-analysis-ocp-gate-ack_4.21_to_4.22_20260327_120000.json  # JSON
```

**Exit Codes:**
- `0`: Successful execution (regardless of upgrade readiness status)
- `1`: Execution failure (e.g., missing tools, network errors, invalid versions)

**Version Resolution:**
- CLI flags > Environment variables > Auto-detect
- Auto-detect: latest stable (baseline) → latest candidate (target)
- Uses minor versions (4.21, 4.22) for file lookups

## Key Validation Checks

1. **Admin Gates Existence**: Checks baseline version for admin gates
2. **Acknowledgment File**: Verifies target version has acknowledgment file
3. **Gate Acknowledgments**: Ensures all baseline gates are acknowledged in target
4. **Extra Acknowledgments**: Reports any extra acknowledgments (informational)

## Upgrade Readiness States

### ✅ UPGRADE READY
- No admin gates in baseline version, OR
- All admin gates are properly acknowledged in target version

### ❌ UPGRADE NOT READY (Blocked)
- **Missing Acknowledgment File**: `deploy/osd-cluster-acks/ocp/{version}/admin-ack.yaml` not found
- **Unacknowledged Gates**: One or more gates exist in baseline but not acknowledged in target

## Output

The script outputs log messages and always exits 0 on successful execution:

**No admin gates (upgrade ready):**

## Data Sources

**Admin Gates (Baseline):**
- Repository: `openshift/cluster-version-operator`
- Branch: `release-{version}` (e.g., `release-4.21`)
- File: `install/0000_00_cluster-version-operator_01_admingate_configmap.yaml`
- URL: https://github.com/openshift/cluster-version-operator/blob/release-4.21/install/0000_00_cluster-version-operator_01_admingate_configmap.yaml

**Admin Acknowledgments (Target):**
- Repository: `openshift/managed-cluster-config`
- Branch: `master`
- File: `deploy/osd-cluster-acks/ocp/{version}/admin-ack.yaml` (e.g., `4.22`)
- URL: https://github.com/openshift/managed-cluster-config/blob/master/deploy/osd-cluster-acks/ocp/4.22/admin-ack.yaml

## Use in CI/CD

```bash
# Script always exits 0 on success
python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py --baseline 4.20 --target 4.21

# Check for upgrade readiness by parsing output
if python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py --baseline 4.20 --target 4.21 2>&1 | grep -q "UPGRADE NOT READY"; then
  echo "❌ Upgrade blocked - check reports for details"
  exit 1
else
  echo "✅ Upgrade ready"
fi

# Use JSON report for programmatic analysis
python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py --baseline 4.20 --target 4.21
if jq -e '.summary.upgrade_ready == false' reports/gap-analysis-ocp-gate-ack_*.json >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "❌ Upgrade not ready"
  jq -r '.analysis.unacknowledged_gates[]' reports/gap-analysis-ocp-gate-ack_*.json
  exit 1
fi
```

## Remediation Actions

**If acknowledgment file is missing:**
1. Create file: `deploy/osd-cluster-acks/ocp/{target_version}/admin-ack.yaml`
2. Add acknowledgments for all required gates from baseline
3. Submit PR to `openshift/managed-cluster-config`

**If gates are unacknowledged:**
1. Add missing gate acknowledgments to existing file
2. Ensure gate names match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Submit PR to `openshift/managed-cluster-config`

**Example acknowledgment file structure:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: admin-acks
  namespace: openshift-managed-upgrade-operator
data:
  ack-4.20-example-gate: "true"
  ack-4.20-another-gate: "true"
```

## Going Beyond the Script

**Manual verification:**
```bash
# Check baseline admin gates
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/cluster-version-operator/release-4.20/install/0000_00_cluster-version-operator_01_admingate_configmap.yaml"

# Check target acknowledgments
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/managed-cluster-config/master/deploy/osd-cluster-acks/ocp/4.21/admin-ack.yaml"
```

**Understanding Admin Gates:**
- Admin gates are safety mechanisms that require explicit acknowledgment before upgrades
- They typically indicate breaking changes or important notices
- Managed clusters (OSD/ROSA) require acknowledgment in managed-cluster-config
- Self-managed clusters can acknowledge via oc CLI

**Integration with Full Gap Analysis:**
- When run via `./scripts/gap-all.sh`, this check is included automatically
- Combined report includes OCP gate acknowledgment status
- Helps ensure comprehensive upgrade readiness validation
