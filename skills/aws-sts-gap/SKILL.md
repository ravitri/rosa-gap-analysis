# AWS STS Policy Gap Analysis

Analyze differences in AWS STS IAM policies between two OpenShift versions.

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill when:
- Comparing STS policies between OpenShift versions (e.g., 4.21 → 4.22)
- Analyzing permission changes for AWS-based managed OpenShift
- Planning version upgrades and need to understand IAM permission changes
- Investigating STS-related issues or permission requirements
- CI/CD pipelines that need to detect policy changes

## What This Skill Does

1. **Extracts credential requests** from OpenShift release payloads using `oc adm release extract`
2. **Converts CredentialsRequest manifests** to consolidated IAM policy JSON documents
3. **Compares IAM permissions** at action-level and service-level to identify changes
4. **Logs policy differences** and always exits 0 on successful execution (only exits 1 on execution failures)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Request

Parse the comparison request to identify:
- Baseline version (default: auto-detect latest stable, e.g., `4.21.6`)
- Target version (default: auto-detect latest candidate, e.g., `4.22.0-ec.3`)
- Specific focus areas (if any)

### Step 2: Run the Gap Analysis Script

Execute the `scripts/gap-aws-sts.py` Python script:

**Auto-detect versions (recommended):**
```bash
# Compares latest stable → latest candidate
python3 ./scripts/gap-aws-sts.py

# Use nightly as target
TARGET_VERSION=NIGHTLY python3 ./scripts/gap-aws-sts.py

# Custom report directory
python3 ./scripts/gap-aws-sts.py --report-dir /custom/reports
```

**Explicit versions:**
```bash
python3 ./scripts/gap-aws-sts.py \
  --baseline <version> \
  --target <version> \
  [--report-dir <path>] \
  [--verbose]

# Examples
python3 ./scripts/gap-aws-sts.py --baseline 4.21.6 --target 4.22.0-ec.3
python3 ./scripts/gap-aws-sts.py --baseline 4.21 --target 4.22
```

**Environment variables:**
```bash
# Override versions
BASE_VERSION=4.21.5 TARGET_VERSION=4.22.0-ec.2 python3 ./scripts/gap-aws-sts.py

# Use nightly
TARGET_VERSION=NIGHTLY python3 ./scripts/gap-aws-sts.py

# Custom report location
REPORT_DIR=/ci-artifacts python3 ./scripts/gap-aws-sts.py
```

**Generated Reports:**
```bash
reports/gap-analysis-aws-sts_4.21.6_to_4.22.0-ec.3_20260325_120000.md    # Markdown
reports/gap-analysis-aws-sts_4.21.6_to_4.22.0-ec.3_20260325_120000.html  # HTML
reports/gap-analysis-aws-sts_4.21.6_to_4.22.0-ec.3_20260325_120000.json  # JSON
```

Note: Platform is always 'aws' for this script.

**The script performs these steps automatically:**
1. Validates prerequisites (jq, oc CLI availability)
2. Extracts credential requests from both versions using `oc adm release extract --credentials-requests --cloud=aws`
3. Parses YAML CredentialsRequest manifests and converts to IAM policy JSON
4. Compares policies at action-level and service-level
5. Logs detected differences and always exits 0 on successful execution

**Exit Codes:**
- `0`: Successful execution (regardless of whether differences were found)
- `1`: Execution failure (e.g., missing tools, network errors, invalid versions)

**This uses the same approach as osdctl** for data extraction.

### Step 3: Data Extraction (Automated)

The script uses `oc adm release extract` to extract credential requests:

**oc adm release extract** (Same as osdctl)
- Directly extracts CredentialsRequest manifests from release image payloads on quay.io
- Command: `oc adm release extract quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:X.Y.Z-x86_64 --credentials-requests --cloud=aws`
- Official, authoritative source - guaranteed to match the actual release
- Requires: `oc` CLI installed and accessible

### Step 4: Policy Conversion and Comparison

**Policy Conversion:**
The script converts CredentialsRequest YAML manifests to IAM policy JSON:
- Parses `spec.providerSpec.statementEntries` from each CredentialsRequest
- Normalizes lowercase keys (`effect`, `action`, `resource`) to IAM format (`Effect`, `Action`, `Resource`)
- Consolidates all statements into a unified policy document
- Removes duplicate statements

**Typical Credential Request Files Processed:**
1. `0000_30_cluster-api_01_credentials-request.yaml` - Cluster API operations
2. `0000_30_machine-api-operator_00_credentials-request.yaml` - Machine/node management
3. `0000_50_cloud-credential-operator_05-iam-ro-credentialsrequest.yaml` - IAM read-only
4. `0000_50_cluster-image-registry-operator_01-registry-credentials-request.yaml` - Image registry
5. `0000_50_cluster-ingress-operator_00-ingress-credentials-request.yaml` - Ingress/load balancers
6. `0000_50_cluster-network-operator_02-cncc-credentials.yaml` - Networking
7. `0000_50_cluster-storage-operator_03_credentials_request_aws.yaml` - Storage volumes

**Comparison Analysis:**
- **Action-level changes**: Specific IAM permissions added/removed (e.g., `ec2:CreateTags`)
- **Service-level changes**: New/removed AWS service integrations (e.g., new `elasticloadbalancing` service)
- **Resource scope changes**: Changes to resource ARNs or wildcards
- **Statement deduplication**: Automatic cleanup to avoid false positives

### Step 5: Interpret Results

The script always exits with code 0 on successful execution and logs:
- Number of added permissions (if any)
- Number of removed permissions (if any)
- Summary message indicating result

The script only exits with code 1 on execution failures:
- Missing required tools (jq, oc CLI)
- Network errors fetching release images
- Invalid version strings
- Other execution errors

**For detailed analysis**, you can examine the temporary comparison files before they're cleaned up by adding custom logic, or re-run the analysis with the `compare_sts_policies` function from `scripts/lib/common.sh`.

## Output Format

The script outputs log messages to stderr and always exits 0 on successful execution:

```
[INFO] Starting AWS STS Policy Gap Analysis
[INFO] Baseline version: 4.21
[INFO] Target version: 4.22
[INFO] Fetching baseline STS policy...
[INFO] Extracting credential requests from quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.21-x86_64 for cloud=aws
[SUCCESS] Credential requests extracted to: /tmp/ocp-crs-XXXXXX
[INFO] Processing 7 credential request file(s)...
[SUCCESS] Converted to IAM policy: 10 unique statement(s)
[SUCCESS] Successfully extracted STS policy
[INFO] Fetching target STS policy...
[SUCCESS] Successfully extracted STS policy
[INFO] Comparing STS policies...
[INFO] Policy differences detected: 3 added, 1 removed
```

Exit code: `0` (successful execution, differences found)

Or:

```
[SUCCESS] No policy differences found between 4.21 and 4.22
```

Exit code: `0` (successful execution, no differences)

## Important Considerations

- **Security focus**: Highlight any permissions with broad scopes or security implications
- **Customer impact**: Note if changes require customer action (IAM role updates)
- **Backward compatibility**: Identify if old permissions are still supported
- **Service account changes**: Track changes to OIDC providers or service accounts

## Going Beyond the Script

The script provides a simple pass/fail check. For detailed analysis, you can:

**Extract Detailed Comparison Data:**
The script automatically generates JSON reports with structured comparison data:
```bash
# Run analysis to generate reports
python3 ./scripts/gap-aws-sts.py --baseline 4.21 --target 4.22

# Extract specific data from JSON report
jq '.comparison.actions.target_only' reports/gap-analysis-aws-sts_*.json  # Added actions
jq '.comparison.actions.baseline_only' reports/gap-analysis-aws-sts_*.json  # Removed actions
jq '.comparison.actions.common' reports/gap-analysis-aws-sts_*.json  # Unchanged actions

# View human-readable report
cat reports/gap-analysis-aws-sts_*.md

# Open HTML report in browser
firefox reports/gap-analysis-aws-sts_*.html
```

**Context and Explanation:**
- Explain *why* permissions changed (link to features, bug fixes, enhancement proposals)
- Connect changes to release notes and known issues
- Identify patterns in permission evolution across versions

**Security Analysis:**
- Assess security posture improvements or regressions
- Highlight permissions with broad scopes (e.g., `Resource: "*"`)
- Flag potentially risky new permissions (e.g., IAM write permissions)
- Recommend least-privilege alternatives when applicable

**Customer Impact:**
- Identify if changes require customer action (IAM role updates)
- Provide step-by-step migration guides for complex changes
- Estimate upgrade impact (breaking changes vs. transparent)
- Suggest pre-upgrade validation steps

**CI/CD Integration:**
- Parse script output to detect policy changes (exit codes only indicate execution success/failure)
- Script always exits 0 on successful execution regardless of differences
- Automate notifications when policies differ by parsing log messages

## osdctl Integration

This skill uses the **same underlying approach as osdctl** for data extraction:

```bash
# osdctl command (simple file diff)
osdctl iampermissions diff -c aws -b 4.21.0 -t 4.22.0

# Our exit-code based check (for CI/CD)
./scripts/gap-aws-sts.sh --baseline 4.21.0 --target 4.22.0
echo $?  # 0 = no changes, 1 = changes detected
```

**What's the same:**
- Both use `oc adm release extract --credentials-requests --cloud=aws`
- Both extract from the same OpenShift release payloads on quay.io
- Both process the same CredentialsRequest YAML files

**What gap-analysis adds:**
- Consolidates CredentialsRequests into unified IAM policy documents
- Performs structured action-level and service-level comparison
- Provides CI/CD-friendly exit codes for automation
- Can be extended to generate detailed reports when needed

## Example Interaction

**User**: "Check if AWS STS policies changed between latest stable and latest candidate"

**Response**:
```bash
# Execute the gap analysis with auto-detection
python3 ./scripts/gap-aws-sts.py
# Reports generated in: ./reports/
```

**User**: "Check if AWS STS policies changed between OpenShift 4.21 and 4.22"

**Response**:
```bash
# Execute the gap analysis
python3 ./scripts/gap-aws-sts.py --baseline 4.21 --target 4.22 --verbose
# View results: cat reports/gap-analysis-aws-sts_*.md
```

**User**: "Check AWS STS policies against latest nightly"

**Response**:
```bash
# Execute with nightly target
TARGET_VERSION=NIGHTLY python3 ./scripts/gap-aws-sts.py
# Review HTML report: firefox reports/gap-analysis-aws-sts_*.html
```

**What happens:**
1. Script validates prerequisites (jq, oc CLI)
2. Extracts credential requests from 4.21 release image using `oc adm release extract`
   - Processes 7 credential request YAML files
   - Converts to consolidated IAM policy with ~10 unique statements
3. Extracts credential requests from 4.22 release image
   - Processes 7 credential request YAML files
   - Converts to consolidated IAM policy with ~10 unique statements
4. Compares policies at action-level and service-level
5. Exits with code based on results

**Sample Output (differences found):**
```
[INFO] Starting AWS STS Policy Gap Analysis
[INFO] Baseline version: 4.21
[INFO] Target version: 4.22
[INFO] Fetching baseline STS policy...
[SUCCESS] Successfully extracted STS policy
[INFO] Fetching target STS policy...
[SUCCESS] Successfully extracted STS policy
[INFO] Comparing STS policies...
[INFO] Policy differences detected: 3 added, 1 removed
```
Exit code: `0` (successful execution)

**Sample Output (no differences):**
```
[INFO] Starting AWS STS Policy Gap Analysis
[INFO] Baseline version: 4.21
[INFO] Target version: 4.22
[SUCCESS] No policy differences found between 4.21 and 4.22
```
Exit code: `0` (successful execution)

**Use in CI/CD:**
```bash
# Script always exits 0 on success
python3 ./scripts/gap-aws-sts.py --baseline 4.21 --target 4.22

# Check for differences by parsing output
if python3 ./scripts/gap-aws-sts.py --baseline 4.21 --target 4.22 2>&1 | grep -q "Policy differences detected"; then
  echo "Policy changes detected - review reports/"
else
  echo "No policy changes - safe to proceed"
fi

# Use JSON report for programmatic analysis
python3 ./scripts/gap-aws-sts.py --baseline 4.21 --target 4.22
if jq -e '.comparison.actions.target_only | length > 0' reports/gap-analysis-aws-sts_*.json >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "New permissions detected"
fi
```

## Practical Tips

**Version Detection:**
- **Auto-detect (recommended)**: No flags needed, compares latest stable → latest candidate
- **Environment variables**: `BASE_VERSION` and `TARGET_VERSION` for CI/CD pipelines
- **Special keywords**: `TARGET_VERSION=NIGHTLY` for nightly builds, `TARGET_VERSION=CANDIDATE` for explicit candidate

**Version Format:**
- Use full version numbers: `4.21.6` or `4.22.0-ec.3`
- Major.minor works too: `4.21`, `4.22`
- Candidate versions: `4.22.0-ec.3`, `4.22.0-rc.1`
- Nightly versions: `4.22.0-0.nightly-2026-03-15-203841`
- Full pullspecs also supported

**Troubleshooting:**
- If `oc adm release extract` fails, the version may not exist
- Verify version exists: `oc adm release info quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:X.Y.Z-x86_64`
- Use `--verbose` flag to see detailed extraction progress
- Ensure `oc` CLI is installed and accessible
- Auto-detection requires `curl` and `jq` for querying release APIs

**Platform:**
- This script analyzes AWS STS policies only (platform is always 'aws')
- Works for all AWS-based OpenShift deployments (OSD, ROSA Classic, ROSA HCP)

**Performance:**
- Auto-detection: 2-5 seconds for version queries
- First-time extraction: 20-60 seconds per version (network-dependent)
- Most time spent downloading release image metadata

**Validation:**
- Always cross-check with osdctl when possible
- Review the raw JSON files in the temp directory if results seem unexpected
- Compare across multiple version pairs to identify patterns
- Auto-detected versions include validation (stable→GA, candidate→dev)
